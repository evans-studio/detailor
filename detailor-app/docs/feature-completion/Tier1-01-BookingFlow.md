## Feature: Booking Flow (Customer → Admin) - Discovery Report

### Previous State (What Was Missing)
- [ ] Guest booking path end-to-end validation (customer creation/vehicle/address bootstrap) across all steps
- [ ] Robust loading/empty/error states in new Enterprise flow (`EnterpriseBookingFlow`)
- [ ] Full mobile UI pass for all steps (vehicle/service/schedule/review/payment)
- [ ] Unsaved changes warning on multi-step form
- [ ] Explicit cancellation/rescheduling flows from Admin detail with confirmations and success toasts
- [ ] Email notifications (booking created, confirmed, cancelled)
- [ ] Slow-network handling and user feedback during API operations
- [ ] Large dataset behavior (services, vehicles, addresses) and performance
- [ ] End-to-end state persistence after refresh at each step (some fields persist; needs full coverage)
- [ ] Permission fallbacks and 404/500 error boundaries for detail pages

### What Works Now
- Customer booking page at `src/app/book/new/page.tsx`:
  - Legacy flow (default): guest support, real services/add-ons via `/api/services` and `/api/add-ons`, real availability (capacity-aware), robust persistence (`bookingFormState`, `pendingBooking`), unsaved changes warning, Stripe checkout (full/deposit), and cancellation banner handling.
  - Enterprise flow (`src/components/booking/EnterpriseBookingFlow.tsx`): service/add-on selection UI, live pricing update via `getQuote`, persisted enterprise state, mobile bottom-sheet summary, payment mode (full/deposit) with checkout, and deposit preview computed from tenant prefs; disabled when not applicable.
- Confirmation page `src/app/bookings/confirmation/page.tsx`:
  - Verifies Stripe session, creates booking (guest vs authenticated paths), cleans up local storage, shows confirmation.
- Admin bookings:
  - List and calendar in `src/app/admin/bookings/page.tsx` with drag-drop and filters; deposit collection integrated.
  - Booking detail `src/app/bookings/[id]/page.tsx`: load booking + invoices, confirm/cancel, collect deposit/balance; Stripe test badge.
- Payments:
  - Checkout session route `/api/payments/checkout-booking` implemented (supports deposits and metadata).
  - Confirmation route `/api/payments/verify-session` present and used by confirmation page.

### Completion Checklist Assessment

#### Core Functionality
- [ ] Happy path works completely end-to-end (guest and authenticated) including invoice visibility
- [ ] Data persists correctly across steps and after refresh
- [ ] Back/forward navigation consistent
- [ ] CRUD operations: cancel/reschedule from admin (and customer, if applicable)

#### States & Feedback
- [ ] Loading states with skeletons/spinners for all steps/panels
- [ ] Empty states with helpful CTAs (vehicles, addresses, services)
- [ ] Error states with clear messages and recovery actions
- [ ] Success confirmations (toasts/redirects) after create/status update/payment
- [ ] Validation messages inline on forms
- [ ] Unsaved changes warnings on multi-step flow

#### Responsiveness & Accessibility
- [ ] Mobile responsive at 375/768/1024
- [ ] Touch targets ≥ 44px on mobile
- [ ] Full keyboard navigation
- [ ] Screen reader announcements for step changes/errors/success
- [ ] Focus management after actions
- [ ] ARIA labels on interactive elements

#### Error Handling
- [ ] Network failure recovery (quote, slots, checkout creation)
- [ ] Invalid data handling
- [ ] Permission denied states
- [ ] 404/500 error boundaries (booking detail)
- [ ] Timeout handling
- [ ] Optimistic updates with rollback (status changes)

#### User Journey Completeness
- [ ] Discoverable entry points
- [ ] Complete primary action (book → pay → confirm)
- [ ] Edit/modify before payment; cancel/undo after
- [ ] Recovery from mistakes (slot unavailable, invalid input)
- [ ] Clear confirmations of success

### Proposed Completion Plan (Pending Approval)
- Add loading/empty/error states to all enterprise steps; skeletons for fetches.
- Extend unsaved changes and refresh continuity to all enterprise steps.
- Admin reschedule flow with optimistic updates and rollback.
- Email notifications: create/confirm/cancel hooks.
- A11y: SR announcements for step changes/errors, focus management, keyboard coverage.
- Mobile pass across steps at 375/768/1024, touch targets ≥ 44px.
- Error boundaries: 404/permission denied.
- E2E matrix (10 scenarios): guest E2E, refresh persistence, network failure recovery, double-booking prevention, mobile interaction, keyboard-only a11y, large dataset performance, slow network, payment decline/retry, browser back/forward.

This file tracks the feature completion against the platform-wide protocol. After approval, PHASE 2 edits will begin and a final Completion Report will replace the pending items with verified checks and links to PRs/tests.
